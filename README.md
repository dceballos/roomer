# Roomer

Roomer is a multitenant framework for Rails using PostgreSQL

## Multitenant Data Strategy

While there are several strategies for multi-tenancy, Roomer uses PostgreSQL's schemas (namespaces) to achieve its goal. You can use Roomer if your application has the below characteristics:

* Each Tenant's data has be to be private to the Tenant.
* No (or minimal) requirement to run cross-tenant queries.

Each Tenant's data is stored in separate schema and shared data is stored in a "global" schema accessible to all the Tenants.

### PostgreSQL "Schemas"

A database in PostgreSQL contains one or more named schemas, which in turn contain tables. Schemas also contain other kinds of named objects, including data types, functions, and operators. The same object name can be used in different schemas without conflict; for example, both schema1 and myschema may contain tables named mytable. Unlike databases, schemas are not rigidly separated: a user may access objects in any of the schemas in the database he is connected to, if he has privileges to do so.

## Usage

### Installation

Roomer currently in pre-release and only supports Rails 3. In your Gemfile insert the below and run "bundle install"

    gem 'roomer', :git => "git://github.com/gosuri/roomer.git"

After you install Roomer and add it to your Gemfile, you need to run the generator. Roomer will use default values "tenant" for Tenant scoped models and "global" for shared models. If you'd like to override the defaults use the optional parameters

```bash
rails generate roomer:install
```

The generator will install an initializer under config/initializers/roomer.rb which describes ALL Roomerâ€™s configuration options and you MUST take a look at it.

### Setup

After you've done the necessary config changes to the initializer, run the setup:

```bash
rails generate roomer:setup
```


### Running Migrations
#### Shared

The setup will generate migrations under db/migrate/[shared_shema_name], by default it should be db/migrate/global. You need to run the shared migrations to setup the tenant tables

```bash
rake roomer:shared:migrate
```

#### Tenanted

This will run migrations under db/migrate. If you set the "config.use_tenanted_migrations_directory" parameter to true, it should run the migrations under db/migrate/[tenant_table_name]/*

```bash
rake roomer:tenanted:migrate
```
#### Both

To run both shared and tenanted use:

```bash
rake roomer:migrate
```

## Models

To enable Roomer on your models, simply call the roomer method and specify the type in your Model Class definition:

```ruby
class Orders < ActiveRecord::Base
  roomer :tenanted
end
```

Roomer supports types of scoped models

* shared: shared by all tenants
* tenanted: scoped to a tenant

Roomer also provides generators

```bash
rails generate roomer:model user name:string email:string
```

Optionally, you can specify --shared flag to generate a shared model

```bash
rails generate roomer:model organizations name:string desc:string --shared
```

Migrations are similar, defaulting to the global schema, 
or optionally --shared for tenanted migration

```bash
rails generate roomer:migration AddPhoneToPerson phone:string
```

```bash
rails generate roomer:migration AddPhoneToPerson phone:string --shared
```


## Development

### Running Tests

Migrate schema is the test rails all
```
cd test/rails_app
bundle exec env RAILS_ENV=test rake roomer:migrate
```

```
rake appraisal test
```
